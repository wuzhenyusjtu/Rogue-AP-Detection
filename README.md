Server:
  We are using web.py framework to develop the server. (See server.py)
  web.py is a web framework for Python that is as simple as it is powerful.
  Visit http://webpy.org/ for more information, where documentation & tutorials are provided.
  You should start from tutorials then go to cookbook for learning webpy.
  Visit http://webpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for more tutorials. (Not that detailed but better organized)
  
Database:
  We are using MySQL database to interact with the server. (See dbOperations.py & init.sql)
  web.py provides APIs to manipulate MySQL. That is to say, we don't need to rely on 3rd party python database libraries. (Like MySQLdb)
  
Client:
  Our client is running on Android device.
  Target minimum Android SDK version: API 10 (Android 2.3.3)
  Compiling Android SDK version: API 22 (Android 5.1.1)
  Please notice that Android SDK installing packages are blocked. You have to turn to VPN or proxy for help.
  developer.android.com is blocked too. Fortunately, we have an API documentation substitution http://www.android-doc.com/reference/packages.html.
