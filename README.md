Server:<br />
  We are using web.py framework to develop the server. (See server.py)<br />
  web.py is a web framework for Python that is as simple as it is powerful.<br />
  Visit http://webpy.org/ for more information, where documentation & tutorials are provided.<br />
  You should start from tutorials then go to cookbook for learning webpy.<br />
  Visit http://webpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for more tutorials. (Not that detailed but better organized)<br />
<br />
Database:<br />
  We are using MySQL database to interact with the server. (See dbOperations.py & init.sql)<br />
  web.py provides APIs to manipulate MySQL. That is to say, we don't need to rely on 3rd party python database access API. (Like "import MySQLdb")<br />
  
Client:<br />
  Our client is running on Android device.<br />
  Target minimum Android SDK version: API 10 (Android 2.3.3)<br />
  Compiling Android SDK version: API 22 (Android 5.1.1)<br />
  Please notice that Android SDK installing packages are blocked. You have to turn to VPN or proxy for help.<br />
  developer.android.com is blocked too. Fortunately, we have an API documentation substitution<br /> http://www.android-doc.com/reference/packages.html.<br />
